# Simple TCP Client

- A basic TCP client implementation in C that connects to a server and allows message exchange.

## Features

- Connects to a local TCP server on port 8080
- Allows sending messages to the server
- Receives responses from server
- Type "exit" to terminate the connection

## Requirements

- Linux/Unix system
- GCC compiler

## Compilation

- Compile the program using gcc:
#### gcc tcp_client.c -o tcp_client

## Usage

- First, make sure the server is running on 127.0.0.1:8080
- After compilation, make sure your client has execution permission:
#### chmod +x tcp_client
- Run the client:
./tcp_client
- Type your message when prompted
- Type "exit" and press Enter to close the connection

## Important Notes

- The server must be running before starting the client
- This is a simple demonstration without robust error handling
- Messages are limited to 1024 bytes
- This code is provided as-is for educational purposes. Feel free to modify and use it as needed.

I'll work on it later. Be patient.

Heres is the same. xD
